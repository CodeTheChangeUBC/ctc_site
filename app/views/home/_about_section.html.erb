        <h4>Our goal is to drive social change through software. By connecting UBC computer science and engineering students to local, non-profit organizations, we provide them with the opportunity to use their technical skills for social good. We are interested in a wide range of issues and enthusiastic about applying a wide range of technologies to contribute to their solutions. You can find the software for our projects <%= link_to "here", 'https://github.com/CodeTheChangeUBC' %>.</h4>
